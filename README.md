# Moodify

Moodify is a simple yet innovative web application built with React that generates personalized playlists based on the user's mood. It's a fun and interactive way to discover music that matches how you're feeling.

## Features

- **Mood Selector**: Choose from a variety of moods (e.g., Happy, inLove, Sad, Angry) to get tailored playlists.
- **Playlist Display**: View song titles, artist names, and album covers in a visually appealing layout.
- **Random Mood Button**: Feeling adventurous? Let the app surprise you with a random mood and playlist.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Optional Features (For Future Enhancements)

- **Search Functionality**: Search for specific songs or artists within the generated playlist.
- **Mood-Based Color Scheme**: The app dynamically changes its theme based on the selected mood.
- **Save Playlist**: Save your favorite playlists locally using browser storage.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- **Mock Data/API**: Integration with Spotify API
- **Deployment**: Github GH Pages

## How It Works

3. **Playlist Display**: The selected playlist is displayed with song details and album art.
4. **Random Mood**: Users can click the "Surprise Me" button to get a random mood and playlist.
5. **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle the app's theme seamlessly.
